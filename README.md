# Reselect

**Rather than go through this readme, check out the [website](http://www.reselect.co/). It's way better.**

Ever deselect when you didn't mean to? Wish you could save a tricky selection that you're doing over and over?

Reselect allows you to restore a previous selection or save selections for later use (even after you close the document!).

If you want to read more about it, check out this [Medium post](https://medium.com/@_fookay/reselect-sketch-plugin-d6ede304883d).
